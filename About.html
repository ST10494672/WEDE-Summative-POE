    <!-- History -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Grace & Grounds Coffeehouse was born in 2023 from a simple prayer: <em>“Lord, give us a place where people can feel loved, seen, and known.”</em> Founded by Sarah and Mark Johnson in the heart of Cape Town, this café was never just about coffee — it was about creating a space where grace could be experienced in the everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspired by Christ’s radical hospitality, we opened our doors with a mission to offer more than caffeine — we offer connection. From the first cup poured to the quiet moments of prayer at the back table, every detail is designed to reflect God’s love in a busy world.
