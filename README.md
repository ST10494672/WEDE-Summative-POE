##  Project Title  
**Grace & Grounds Coffeehouse: A Faith-Based Community Café Website — Part 2: External Styling & Responsive Design**  

##  Overview  
Grace & Grounds Coffeehouse is a faith-centered café in Cape Town, founded by Sarah and Mark Johnson in 2023.  
The café provides a welcoming space where guests can enjoy quality coffee, connect with others, and experience God’s grace through hospitality, prayer, and community events.  

This second phase of the website project refactors the site to use a **single external CSS stylesheet**.  
The update improves:  
- Styling consistency  
- Maintainability  
- Responsiveness across all devices  

All while keeping the original mission and structure intact.  

##  Mission and Vision  
**Mission**  
- To provide a peaceful, inclusive space where people connect and experience God’s love — both in person and online.  

**Vision**  
- To build a thriving, faith-centered digital community where every interaction reflects grace, generosity, and purpose.  

##  Goals for Part 2  
- Use an external CSS file (`styles.css`) to remove inline duplication  
- Apply consistent typography, colors, and layout across all five pages  
- Ensure full responsiveness with media queries and relative units (`rem`, `%`)  
- Enhance accessibility with semantic HTML, focus states, and ARIA-friendly elements  
- Simplify maintenance with centralized styling in one file  

##  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
- Growth in unique visitors per month  
- Event RSVPs and attendance  
- Email sign-ups for devotionals  
- Volunteer applications  
- Online donations
